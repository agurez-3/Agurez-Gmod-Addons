# Agurez-Gmod-Addons
My name is Agurez, and I’m a Garry’s Mod developer with a passion for creating engaging and innovative content. Over time, I realized that my interest in developing for specific Garry’s Mod servers had decreased, so I decided to shift my focus toward creating GMod addons for a wider audience. My goal is to build tools, features, and experiences that other players and developers can enjoy, modify, and learn from.

To support the community and encourage collaboration, I make some of my addons open source. This way, anyone can study my work, contribute improvements, or adapt it for their own projects. By sharing my creations openly, I hope to inspire others, foster creativity, and help the Garry’s Mod community grow stronger and more vibrant.
